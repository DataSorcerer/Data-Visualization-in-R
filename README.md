# Data-Visualization-in-R

If text and numbers can make data talk, then visuals can make data sing and dance before the viewers! This repository is a compilation of my attempts to visualize different stories that underlying data reveals.
The visualizations are done with R as it has a rich set of packages on offer. The visual stories often include:  
1. Data preprocessing (using tidyr/ dplyr and others)   
2. Visualization (primarily ggplot2; exploring other useful packages too)   
3. Detailed report with my observations and conclusions
